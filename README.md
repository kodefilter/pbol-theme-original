# WordPress Theme Development Project

I did this project a few years ago as an intern for a research and development company for a fixed duration of 6 months during my studies.
My main task was to learn about web accessibility and put that knowledge to use by transforming the comapanys existing static site into a
CMS based site adhereing the principles of web accessibility.

After learning about web accessibility I had to find a modern CMS suitable for the project. I read and learned different CMS and finally
decided to go with WordPress for its simplicity and learning curve. The most challenging task for me was to make the theme look similar to the existing static site using same color scheme and structure.

Here is the final version of the site
